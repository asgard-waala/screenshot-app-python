# Screenshot application using Python

> This is my first Python project.


## Feel free to give me suggestions and guide me on this new journey.

### Issues:

- When the GUI opens, it takes a screenshot of itself along with the page.
- The naming convention for `.png` files is built on `time` module, but I wanted to make it on `datetime` like **DDMMYYYY-HHMMSS**.
